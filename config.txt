#Welcome to the config file!
#Keep in mind that you need to use a GFX plugin that has texture pack support like GLideN64.
[PATHS]

#In "SM64Dir" you need to put the path to your SM64 hi-res texture folder.
#In "Eyes1", "Eyes2", "Eyes3", "Cap", "Hair", "Mustache" and "Button" you have names for the eye textures,
#the cap and every other Mario texture.
#They are already set, but there could be a possibility that you need to change them
#(If there is, don't forget to NOT put the file extension in the names).
#
#"Eyes1" is the fully open eyes texture.
#"Eyes2" is the half open eyes textures.
#"Eyes3" is the closed eyes texture. All of this also applies to the "AddEyes" textures.
#
#If you also want to have the textures while loading an SM64 savestate in a different game for spazzing,
#then in "AddDir" add the path for that game's hi-res texture folder. You also need to provide the names
#for the textures in "Add" variables. Otherwise you can leave all of them blank.
#
#To add eye textures, go to the "eyes" folder and drop a folder with the eye textures.
#For the other textures it's the same, but you need to drop it into the "chmb" folder instead.
#For katarakta to recognize the textures, each texture should have the names
#that you have in the variables.
