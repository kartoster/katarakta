#Welcome to the config file!
#Keep in mind that you need to use a GFX plugin that has texture pack support like GLideN64
[PATHS]

#In "SM64Dir" you need to put the path to your SM64 hi-res texture folder.
#In "Eyes1", "Eyes2", "Eyes3" you have names for the eye textures,
#they are already set, but there could be a possibility that you need to change them
#(If there is, then don't put the file extension in the names).
#
#"Eyes1" is the fully open eyes texture.
#"Eyes2" is the half open eyes textures.
#"Eyes3" is the closed eyes texture. All of this also applies to the "AddEyes" textures.
#
#If you also want to have the eye textures while loading an SM64 savestate in a different game for spazzing,
#then in "AddDir" add the path for that game's hi-res texture folder. You also need to provide the names
#for the eye textures in "AddEyes" variables. Otherwise you can leave all of them blank.
#
#To add eye textures, go to the "eyes" folder and drop a folder with the eye textures.
#For katarakta to recognize the eye textures, each texture should have the names
#that you have in "Eyes1", "Eyes2", "Eyes3", "AddEyes1", "AddEyes2" and "AddEyes3" variables.
