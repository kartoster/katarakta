# katarakta
katarakta is a tool for Super Mario 64 machinimas that enables you to change Mario's textures quicker and makes it a lot less tedious.

# Setting Up
After downloading the archive, extract it somewhere. Open `config.txt` and follow the instructions.\
What you need to run is `katarakta.exe`\
`kataraktaConsole.exe` is, obviously, the console version of katarakta, this version was made for testing, it does not have all the features the GUI version has and you probably would not want to use that.

# Plans
There is some stuff I want to add in the future (This list might get bigger if I get any more ideas):
- Making everything configurable through the program itself.
- Making the window resizable.
- Optimize the code.
- A button for deleting the textures you have set from the hi-res folders.

# Some questions you might be asking
**What are additional textures?**\
You know how for Mario spazzing you load a Super Mario 64 savestate while another game is running?\
Well, to have Mario's texture changed in that case, you need to have another textures in that game's hi-res textures folder.\
I call these other textures the "additional" textures.

**Why is the name "katarakta"?**\
It's romanized "cataract" in Russian. It doesn't really have any meaning and I just thought it was funny.

**Is it translated to any other languages?**\
As of 1.1.0, katarakta is translated to Ukrainian and Russian (The language can be changed in `config.txt`).

**Do you know about SM64 Eye Changer from ImCodist?**\
As you probably guessed by seeing this question here, yes.\
I already knew about it even before creating katarakta (and SM64EC actually inspired me to make katarakta!), but I still decided to create it because I needed it for my own personal use and SM64EC did not have some features I needed, such as the additional textures and ability to change Mario's other textures besides the eyes.
