# katarakta
katarakta is a tool for Super Mario 64 machinimas that enables you to change Mario's textures quicker and makes it a lot less tedious.

# Setting Up
## For 1.4.0+
After downloading the archive, extract it somewhere. What you need to run is `katarakta.exe`, you can (and need) to configure it by going to `Options` > `Settings`. After configuring, click `Save`.
## For 1.0.0 - 1.3.0
After downloading the archive, extract it somewhere. Open `config.txt` and follow the instructions. There are also guides in Ukrainian and Russian.\
What you need to run is `katarakta.exe`\
`kataraktaConsole.exe` is, obviously, the console version of katarakta, this version was made for testing, it lacks some features the GUI version has and you probably would not want to use that.

# Some questions you might be asking
**If I use katarakta for my work, should I credit you?**\
Credit is optional.

**What are additional textures?**\
You know how for Mario spazzing you load a Super Mario 64 savestate while another game is running?\
Well, to have Mario's texture changed in that case, you need to have another textures in that game's hi-res textures folder.\
I call these other textures the "additional" textures.

**Why is the name "katarakta"?**\
It's romanized "cataract" in Russian. It doesn't really have any meaning and I just thought it was funny.

**Is it translated to any other languages?**\
As of 1.4.8, katarakta is translated to Ukrainian, Russian and Kazakh (Cyrillic and Latin).

**Do you know about SM64 Eye Changer from ImCodist?**\
As you probably guessed by seeing this question here, yes.\
I already knew about it even before creating katarakta (and SM64EC actually inspired me to make katarakta!), but I still decided to create it because I needed it for my own personal use and SM64EC did not have some features I needed, such as the additional textures and ability to change Mario's other textures besides the eyes.
